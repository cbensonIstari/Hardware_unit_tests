# Demonstrating Hardware Unit Tests with the DoD 516C (Airworthiness)

This repository demonstrates how unit tests can be applied to cyber-physical systems, focusing on a 'digital-first' approach for evaluating compliance with the DoD 516C airworthiness standard.

Below is an overall assessment of the current status of automated 516C testing:

## Badge Legend

Each badge provides a quick, visual indicator of the status of specific criteria:

- ![Passing](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Passing-green) **Green:** The criterion has been fully met.
- ![Concerns](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Concerns-yellow) **Yellow:** The criterion has some issues or requires further attention.
- ![Failed](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Failed-red) **Red:** The criterion has not been met.
- ![Not Applicable](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Not%20Applicable-gray) **Gray:** The criterion does not apply to this system or project.

## Independent 516C Airworthiness Testing

Several independent entities have conducted tests to validate compliance with the 516C airworthiness standard. These tests provide a broad evaluation of the system’s reliability, ensuring that different perspectives and operational conditions are accounted for.

## Criteria-by-Criteria 516C Airworthiness Evaluation

This section provides a detailed, **criteria-by-criteria** breakdown of the 516C airworthiness certification process. Each major category, such as Systems Engineering, Structures, and Propulsion, is evaluated against specific criteria to determine compliance with 516C standards.

The table below outlines the **current status**, **last test date**, **key observations**, and **assigned Points of Contact (POC)** for each individual criterion. This granular approach ensures transparency in how each specific criterion has been assessed and highlights areas that meet or need to meet the required airworthiness standards.

Each criterion is individually reviewed to give a clear, comprehensive understanding of the airworthiness certification status.
