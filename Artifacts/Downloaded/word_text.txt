Analysis of Alternatives (AoA) for Class III Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) for the Department of DefenseExecutive SummaryThis report presents an Analysis of Alternatives (AoA) for selecting a Class III Unmanned Aerial System (UAS) for the Department of Defense (DoD). Class III UASs are characterized by their ability to carry a payload greater than 150 pounds, extended range, and advanced capabilities for reconnaissance, surveillance, and target acquisition. The analysis compares three alternatives based on operational effectiveness, cost, risk, and technical maturity./1. Introduction1.1 PurposeThe purpose of this AoA is to evaluate and compare multiple UAS options to identify the most suitable Class III UAS for the DoD's operational requirements.1.2 ScopeThis report examines three Class III UAS alternatives: Alternative A, Alternative B, and Alternative C. The analysis includes an assessment of each option's capabilities, costs, risks, and technical readiness.2. Alternatives Description2.1 Alternative A: Raven X3Manufacturer: AeroTech IndustriesPayload Capacity: 200 lbsRange: 500 milesEndurance: 20 hoursKey Features: Advanced sensors, stealth capabilities, autonomous navigation.2.2 Alternative B: SkyGuardianManufacturer: General DynamicsPayload Capacity: 250 lbsRange: 600 milesEndurance: 24 hoursKey Features: High-definition ISR (Intelligence, Surveillance, Reconnaissance), encrypted communication, modular payload bays.2.3 Alternative C: Eagle Eye 3000Manufacturer: Lockheed MartinPayload Capacity: 220 lbsRange: 550 milesEndurance: 22 hoursKey Features: Real-time data link, robust countermeasures, multi-mission capabilities.3. Evaluation Criteria3.1 Operational EffectivenessOperational effectiveness assesses how well each UAS meets mission requirements, including payload capacity, range, endurance, sensor capabilities, and overall mission versatility.3.2 CostCost evaluation includes initial procurement costs, lifecycle costs, including maintenance, training, and operational expenses.3.3 RiskRisk analysis considers technical, operational, and programmatic risks, including technology maturity, integration challenges, and potential for obsolescence.3.4 Technical MaturityTechnical maturity evaluates the readiness level of each UAS based on Technology Readiness Levels (TRLs) and the potential need for further development or testing.4. Analysis of Alternatives4.1 Operational EffectivenessAlternative A: Raven X3Strengths: Excellent stealth capabilities, advanced autonomous features.Weaknesses: Slightly lower payload capacity compared to Alternative B.Alternative B: SkyGuardianStrengths: Highest payload capacity, longest endurance.Weaknesses: Higher dependency on secure communication infrastructure.Alternative C: Eagle Eye 3000Strengths: Balanced capabilities, strong countermeasures.Weaknesses: Mid-range in both payload and endurance.4.2 CostAlternative A: Raven X3Initial Cost: $15 million per unitLifecycle Cost: $40 million over 10 yearsAlternative B: SkyGuardianInitial Cost: $18 million per unitLifecycle Cost: $45 million over 10 yearsAlternative C: Eagle Eye 3000Initial Cost: $16 million per unitLifecycle Cost: $42 million over 10 years4.3 RiskAlternative A: Raven X3Technical Risk: Medium (advanced features but proven technology)Operational Risk: Low (highly autonomous)Alternative B: SkyGuardianTechnical Risk: Medium (requires secure communication)Operational Risk: Medium (dependence on infrastructure)Alternative C: Eagle Eye 3000Technical Risk: Low (proven technology)Operational Risk: Medium (balanced capabilities)4.4 Technical MaturityAlternative A: Raven X3TRL: 7 (Prototype demonstration in operational environment)Alternative B: SkyGuardianTRL: 6 (System/subsystem model or prototype demonstration in relevant environment)Alternative C: Eagle Eye 3000TRL: 8 (Actual system completed and qualified through test and demonstration)5. RecommendationBased on the evaluation of operational effectiveness, cost, risk, and technical maturity, the recommended Class III UAS for the DoD is Alternative C: Eagle Eye 3000. Although it has a mid-range payload and endurance, it offers a balanced capability set, strong countermeasures, and the lowest technical risk with a high level of technical maturity.6. ConclusionThis AoA provides a comprehensive comparison of three Class III UAS alternatives. The recommended choice, the Eagle Eye 3000, meets the DoD's operational needs while minimizing risk and ensuring technical readiness.
