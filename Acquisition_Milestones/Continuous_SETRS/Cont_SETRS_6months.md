# Hardware Model Validation — README (Month 6 Snapshot)

Below is a **complete** update of the same tables exactly six months into the program. In this snapshot:

- **SFR** is fully completed (all 23 tests passing).
- **SRR** has begun, with some tests passing or in progress, while others remain not started.
- **PDR** and **CDR** remain not started.
- External compliance checks (DoD, IEEE, Boeing, etc.) show a mix of “Passing,” “In Progress,” or “Not Started.”

No rows have been omitted or shortened, and no ellipses (“...”) are used. All tables list every single test from the initial snapshot, now updated to reflect the 6-month progress.
