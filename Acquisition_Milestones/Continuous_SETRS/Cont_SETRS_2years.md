# Hardware Model Validation — README (Month 24 Snapshot)

Below is the **complete** set of tables **two years** into the program. All previously listed tests remain, but now many have updated statuses:

- **SFR** (System Functional Review) is fully completed.
- **SRR** (System Requirements Review) is fully completed.
- **PDR** (Preliminary Design Review) is almost complete; a few tests have concerns.
- **CDR** (Critical Design Review) is in progress; many tests are passing, but some remain in progress or flagged with concerns.
- External compliance checks (DoD, IEEE, Boeing, etc.) are mostly passing, with a few “Concerns” around Tesla manufacturability.

No lines are omitted. Every single test from the previous snapshots is listed again with updated statuses.
